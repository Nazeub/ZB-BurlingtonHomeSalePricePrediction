# Problem Set 5

In this problem set, you will use a simple linear regression model to predict the sale price of a house based on its finished square footage.

The data set is in the file `SingleFamilyLessThan1M.csv`. The first column is the finished square footage of the house, and the second column is the sale price of the house. This is a real data set, based on public data. It contains information about all single family home sales in Burlington, VT for less than $1M in 2021.

You are being provided code to load the data set and plot it. This includes code to create a linear regression model from the data. This code is sufficent for the first couple of questions in the accompanying quiz on Canvas. For later questions in the quiz, you will need to add additional code.

Note that you will need to install `matplotlib` to run this code. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
```

Depending on your personal computer's setup, it may be `pip` instead of `pip3`.

## Hints

- Make sure you understand all of the fundamental statistics before you start (standard deviation, mean, r-squared, etc.).
- Carefully read through the provided code. It is not very long, and it is very important that you understand it.
- You don't need to write a lot of code, just the right code. Do not rely on GitHub Copilot without understanding everything that it is writing for you. It does not always write the correct code.

## Rules

1. You must complete this problem set individually. You can discuss it with a friend, but you should not be copying their code or looking at their code despite the final result of this being a quiz on Canvas.
2. You must complete this assignment using the provided statistical functions. Do not use a third party Python library, or Excel, or R. You can certainly double check your work with a calculator or Excel if you want though. But keep in mind the accuracy of our statistical functions may differ from Excel or R and the Canvas quiz answers depend on the accuracy of our statistical functions.

## Setup

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Install matplotlib (`pip3 install matplotlib`).
3. Complete the assignment quiz on Canvas.

## Grading

This particular problem set is based on a quiz on Canvas that you can only take one time. Each question is worth 1 point. You have unlimited time on the quiz until the deadline, but you can only submit it once.

## Note on Repository Access

This repository should stay private. If you make it public, you are possibly providing your solution to other students taking the class. Generally the problem sets in this class are not great portfolio projects because they are too small, or contain a significant portion of code that is not your own and therefore do not demonstrate your skill. Please keep your repository private so other students can't use your solution.
